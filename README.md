# Hockey All Stars

---

## Introduction

This is a TypeScript and React project that I've developed with visual appearance managed by both Styled-components and CSS, offering an card game experience featuring 100 NHL players. The deck includes 50 legendary players and 50 current superstars, all personally selected and ranked based on my own opinion!

In this game, you face off against the CPU, competing to see who has the highest-ranking card in each round. The goal is to win 50 rounds to claim victory!

Key Features:

Player Selection: A unique blend of 50 NHL legends and 50 modern-day superstars.
Custom Rankings: Players are ranked based on my personal evaluation, adding a distinctive touch to the game.
Simple and Fun: Easy to understand and play, making it enjoyable for hockey fans of all ages.
Card Gallery: Featuring a card gallery for all 100 player card for the user to view!
